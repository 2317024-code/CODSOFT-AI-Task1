# Rule-Based Chatbot in Python  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates a **simple rule-based chatbot** built in Python. The chatbot uses predefined rules and keyword matching to respond to user inputs. It is a beginner-friendly implementation that shows how conversational agents work without using machine learning or NLP libraries.  

## Features  
- Responds to **greetings** (e.g., "hello", "hi")  
- Replies to **basic questions** such as "who are you" or "how are you"  
- Provides **help information** about supported queries  
- Ends the conversation politely when the user types **"bye"**, **"exit"**, or **"quit"**  
- Handles unrecognized inputs with a fallback response  

## Technologies Used  
- Python (no external libraries required)
- VS Code
